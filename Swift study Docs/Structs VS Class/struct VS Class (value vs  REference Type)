Whenever you create an enum or a struct , it is a value type 

and a Class is a reference type.

Value Type: Struct , Enum
Reference Type: Class


When you pass a class object around your program, you are actually passing a reference to that object, so different parts of your program can share and modify your object. 

When you pass a structure [ or enum] around your program, what gets passes around is a copy of the structure. So modifications to structures donâ€™t get shared.

One of the major benefits of value types is that they are thread-safe not requiring any synchronization.
